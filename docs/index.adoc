== Description

Several 

== Source Code

As for any grade based project, the source code is available in the `src/` folder of each module.

=== Build

This project is using gradle.

Command to build the sources locally:

----
./gradlew build
----

Command to deploy to your local maven repository:

----
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
----

Command to build the documentation page:

----
./gradlew asciidoctor
----

The output of this command is an HTML page located at `<git repo root>/build/docs/html5/index.html`.

==== For project maintainers

`signing.gnupg.keyName` and `signing.gnupg.passphrase` are expected to be set in your local `gradle.properties` file to be able to sign.
`sonatypeUser` and `sonatypePassword` are expected to be set in order to be able to publish to a distant repository.
					
Command to build and publish the result to maven central:

----
./gradlew publishToNexus
----

Command to upload the documentation page on GitHub pages:

----
./gradlew gitPublishPush
----

Command to perform a release:

----
./gradlew release -Prelease.useAutomaticVersion=true
----

==== Using ssh-agent

Some tasks requires pushing into the distant git repository (release task or updating the `gh-pages` branch).
If they are failing with errors like this:
----
org.eclipse.jgit.api.errors.TransportException: ... Permission denied (publickey).
---- 

Then `ssh-agent` can be used.
----
eval `ssh-agent -s`
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
----
